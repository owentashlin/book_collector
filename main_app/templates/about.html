    <h3>Collect Books with the Book Collector!</h3>
    <p>With this app, you can keep track of your favorite books, recent reads, or just make a nice big digital 'TBR' pile (we all have them, don't be shy!). 
        
    <p> In the books section you can add, remove, update and view the books on your list. Add your own thoughts, or a simple summary of the story you want to save, as well as a rating to indicate how much you loved it when you are done. 
        
    <p>In the Tea section, you can add favorite blends, ideal steeping times and urls for favorite online retailers of tea. You can also add a note for when you started your last cup, so you don't forget to drink it!</p>

    <p>Welcome to your personal library! Come in, sit down and relax with a book and a nice cup of tea.</p>
