**Books & Tea**
Books and Tea is an app that allows a user to login, and create a person library of books and tea. Items can be added in their individual libraries with descriptions and ratings to indicate how much they did or did not enjoy them.

In the Book section, once an item is saved, users can mark their place with a date and select their favorite tea to go with each book.
